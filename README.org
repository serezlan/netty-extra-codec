* Overview

An extra codec for netty to support penn testing.

* Background

Although Netty is wonderful library and easy to use, by default it puts limitation on itself to follow RFC guidelines.
This is favorable for most users but lack the freedom needed to conduct penn testing.
Therefore I decided to create an extra codec to address this issue. Since netty is build with modularity in mind, this is quite easy to accomplish.

* Features
** Disable transfer encoding detection. 
On HTTP smuggling, we need to send payload as is. This is accomplished by disabling transfer encoding detection on HttpRequest.
* Usage 

- Add the following to your pom.xml

<dependency>
  <groupId>io.netty</groupId>
  <artifactId>netty-extra-codec</artifactId>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

- On your initializer, replace HttpClientCodec with ModHttpClientCodec
